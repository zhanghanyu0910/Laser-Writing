# Laser-Writing
This is a Laser-Writing program using Ni PCIE-6363 to expose photo-resistant. The default counter to control laser on/off is CTR0, and we use Dev1/AO0 and Dev1/AO1 to control X and Y movement respectively.

## Bugs
The stop scan button cannot actually stop the program. So I use stop button in pycharm to stop the process manually.
